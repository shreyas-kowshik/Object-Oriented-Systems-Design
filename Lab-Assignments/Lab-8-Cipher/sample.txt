Although there are many short stories, every short story is a sample short story. Many of our readers have asked us to add more such samples. In response to their request, we have formed an expert team of story-narrators and asked them to collect as many short stories as possible. You can read these short stories one by one and note down the positive and the negative points as per your perception. Then try to rewrite the same short story in your own words using your own style. Then ask your friends or your professors to correct your version. This way of rewriting the same story will give you better idea of how to write short story. Of course, over the period of time, you should shed all the methods of duplication and develop your own style of writing a short story.

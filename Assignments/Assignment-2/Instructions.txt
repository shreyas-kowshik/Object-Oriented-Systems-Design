This is a general code to run for any value of the inputs.
The input points can be entered manually or can be generated randomly. This will write the generated input points to a file and will use it for further processing.

You can repeat the values of the x and y co-ordinates for the points and the algorithm will give you the number of points in a query rectangle. 

To run : 
g++ query.cpp
./a.out
